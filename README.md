## Description

This simple user script adds a reply button to GitHub comments. It is originally derived from [@jerone](https://github.com/jerone)'s [UserScripts](https://github.com/jerone/UserScripts/tree/master/Github_Reply_Comments) project.

When clicked, the reply button will pre-fill the comment box with:

```Markdown
_Replying to https://github.com/orginization/repo/issues/issue_number#comment-id by @author:_
```

## Example

On https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/issues/129

![reply1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aensley/github-comment-reply-buttons/master/assets/reply1.png)

Clicking the **Reply** button takes you to the comment form pre-filled with:

![reply2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aensley/github-comment-reply-buttons/master/assets/reply2.png)

Which renders as:
